# LLM Training Pipeline Guide

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Streamlit web application that provides an interactive guide through the complete Large Language Model (LLM) training pipeline. The application serves as an educational tool, walking users through each stage of LLM development from data collection to deployment with detailed explanations, visualizations, and practical examples.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Application title: Changed from "ðŸ¤– Complete LLM Training Pipeline Guide" to "Ogelo Concise LLM Training Pipeline Guide" (July 15, 2025)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web framework for rapid prototyping and data visualization
- **Structure**: Multi-page application with a main dashboard and dedicated pages for each pipeline stage
- **Navigation**: Sidebar-based navigation with progress tracking and stage status indicators
- **Visualization**: Plotly integration for interactive charts, flowcharts, and data visualizations

### Application Structure
- **Main App** (`app.py`): Central dashboard with navigation and progress tracking
- **Page-based Architecture**: Separate Python files for each pipeline stage (01-08)
- **Utility Modules**: 
  - `utils/pipeline_data.py`: Data structures and content for pipeline stages
  - `utils/visualizations.py`: Plotly-based visualization functions

## Key Components

### 1. Interactive Dashboard (`app.py`)
- **Session State Management**: Tracks user progress through pipeline stages
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bar and completion status
- **Navigation System**: Sidebar with clickable stage buttons and status icons

### 2. Pipeline Stage Pages
Each stage is implemented as a separate Streamlit page:
- **Data Collection** (`02_Data_Collection.py`): Data gathering and curation
- **Data Preprocessing** (`03_Data_Preprocessing.py`): Data cleaning and formatting
- **Model Architecture** (`04_Model_Architecture.py`): Neural network design decisions
- **Training** (`05_Training.py`): Core model training process
- **Fine-Tuning** (`06_Fine_Tuning.py`): Task-specific adaptation
- **Evaluation** (`07_Evaluation.py`): Performance measurement and validation
- **Deployment** (`08_Deployment.py`): Production deployment strategies

### 3. Supporting Utilities
- **Pipeline Data Module**: Centralized content management for stage definitions, examples, and metadata
- **Visualization Module**: Reusable Plotly chart functions for interactive diagrams and data visualization

## Data Flow

1. **User Navigation**: Users navigate through pipeline stages via sidebar controls
2. **State Management**: Streamlit session state tracks progress and current stage
3. **Content Rendering**: Each page renders stage-specific content with interactive elements
4. **Progress Tracking**: Completion status is maintained across sessions
5. **Visualization**: Dynamic charts and diagrams are generated based on stage data

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for data science applications
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualization library for charts and graphs

### Data Processing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis (used in visualizations)
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing support

### Visualization Components
- **Plotly Graph Objects**: Low-level plotting interface for custom charts
- **Plotly Express**: High-level plotting interface for rapid visualization

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Designed for Replit deployment with Python runtime
- **Configuration**: Uses `st.set_page_config()` for Streamlit page settings
- **Port Configuration**: Standard Streamlit port (8501) for web serving

### Production Considerations
- **Scalability**: Stateless application design suitable for cloud deployment
- **Resource Requirements**: Minimal compute requirements, primarily CPU for web serving
- **Caching**: Streamlit's built-in caching mechanisms for performance optimization

### Deployment Options
1. **Replit Hosting**: Direct deployment on Replit platform
2. **Cloud Platforms**: Compatible with Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, AWS, GCP
3. **Container Deployment**: Can be containerized with Docker for Kubernetes deployment

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Not currently used but can be added for configuration
- **Static Assets**: Self-contained with no external asset dependencies
- **Database**: No persistent storage required - uses session state for user progress

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Streamlit Framework Choice
- **Problem**: Need for rapid development of interactive educational tool
- **Solution**: Streamlit for its simplicity and built-in data visualization capabilities
- **Rationale**: Allows focus on content rather than frontend development complexity

### 2. Multi-page Architecture
- **Problem**: Large amount of content across multiple pipeline stages
- **Solution**: Separate pages for each stage with centralized navigation
- **Benefits**: Modular structure, easier maintenance, better user experience

### 3. Session State for Progress Tracking
- **Problem**: Need to track user progress through pipeline stages
- **Solution**: Streamlit session state to maintain completion status
- **Benefits**: Persistent progress within session, simple implementation

### 4. Plotly for Visualizations
- **Problem**: Need for interactive, educational visualizations
- **Solution**: Plotly for interactive charts and custom diagrams
- **Benefits**: Rich interactivity, web-native, integrates well with Streamlit

### 5. Utility Module Organization
- **Problem**: Code reusability and maintainability across pages
- **Solution**: Separate utility modules for data and visualizations
- **Benefits**: DRY principle, centralized content management, easier updates
